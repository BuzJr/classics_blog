Source Code For My Full Stack Blog WebSite


This project was started on 1/19/23

The source code in this repository is for running on a local host.

To run it you will need to download or clone the repository, then in MySQL or SQL, create a database named Blog with two tables: Posts and Users. 
Posts Columns: id, title, desc, img, date, uid, cat, text. Users Columns: id, username, email, password. After doing this you will need to create a 
JavaScript file in the API folder that exports "db" which is configured based on your SQL local host settings.
